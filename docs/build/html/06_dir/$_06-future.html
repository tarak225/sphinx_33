<p>Ontomatica anticipates that USDA, in the future, will want to use the following technologies. Ontomatica’s platform uses these technologies and will make them available to USDA at the appropriate time.</p>

<h2>Linked Data<a class="headerlink" href="#linked-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Linked Data is a method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF and URIs. Rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, Linked Data extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. Linking enables data from different sources to be connected and queried. Tim Berners-Lee, director of the World Wide Web Consortium, coined the term in a design note discussing issues around the Semantic Web project. For more information see: <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="../13_dir/%24_13-bibliography-7-misc-web.html#id2" title="Wikipedia. Linked Data. last accessed: 17-Nov-2014.

Term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee. When vision is implemented, computers will perform more of the tedious work involved in finding, combining, and acting upon information on the World Wide Web. However, implementation of vision requires that information sources be semantically structured. Standards for semantic data structures are led by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). By encouraging inclusion of semantic content in web pages, W3C aims at converting the current web, dominated by unstructured and semi-structured documents, into a 'web of data.'.

Device interconnection is expected to enable new levels of automation. In the fields of food, nutrition and health, 'things' may be devices that monitor well-being and act as emergency notification systems. Devices may range from blood and heart rate monitors to specialized implants, such as pacemakers or hearing aids. Devices also may be agents that ensure proper treatment is administered, such as non-allergic foods or time- and food-sensitive drugs. IoT also includes data used by devices. Semantic Web applications make uniquely identifiable data 'addressable' through naming protocols, such as Uniform resource identifiers (URI). Data 'things' do not converse, but may be acted upon by other agents, such as embedded devices and centralized servers working for their human owners.

Semantic network. last accessed: 17-Nov-2014. Wikipedia link about semantic network (SN) - a network for documenting relationships among concepts and for representing knowledge. SN is a directed graph consisting of vertices or nodes that represent concepts, and edges or arcs that represent relationships. The arcs and nodes can be organized into a taxonomic hierarchy. An example is WordNet, a lexical database of English. It groups English words into sets of synonyms called synsets. Synsets document semantic relations among synonyms. Examples are meronymy (A is part of B, i.e. B has A as a part of itself), holonymy (B is part of A, i.e. A has B as a part of itself), hyponymy (A is subordinate of B; A is kind of B), hypernymy (A is superordinate of B), synonymy (A denotes the same as B) and antonymy (A denotes the opposite of B).

<h2>Reasoning and Reasoners<a class="headerlink" href="#reasoning-and-reasoners" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reasoning software programs (Reasoners) infer logical consequences from set of facts. Logical consequence (a.k.a. entailment) is the relationship between statements that hold true when one logically “follows from” another. A valid logical argument is one where conclusions follow from its premises, and its conclusions are consequences of its premises. Ontomatica uses Reasoners to verify that an electronic food label is consistent with a food labeling ontology and that ingredients in a food label are consistent with food identity (as asserted by the electronic food label).

<p>To illustrate reasoning, Ontomatica uses a well-known logic puzzle - the Zebra Puzzle (a.k.a. the Einstein Puzzle). The puzzle makes 15 assertions (statements about a certain premise that are accepted as true). Two questions are posed for which answers can be deduced from the assertions. To learn the answer, Ontomatica implemented Zebra Puzzle in an ontology editor (Stanford University’s Protege) using the HermiT reasoner. The answer is shown on the page above. For more information see: <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="../13_dir/%24_13-bibliography-7-misc-web.html#id48" title="Wikipedia. Protege. last accessed: 17-Nov-2014.
