|     I keep six honest serving-men (they taught me all I knew);
|     Their names are What and Why and When
|     and How and Where and Who.

These six questions are tools to gain knowledge.

In science, two important questions are "How" and "Why" things are `related`.

Discovery processes investigate `relationships among things`.

Ontologies are systematic tools for recording knowledge and documenting `relationships among things`.

Ontomatica integrates knowledge and informatics for foods, agricultural commodities, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals to present important `relationships among them`.
