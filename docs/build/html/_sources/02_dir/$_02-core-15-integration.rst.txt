Ontomatica Coverage
-------------------

Ontomatica integrates data from projects sponsored by the following :ref:`authorities <terms-Authority>`.

Integration enables Ontomatica to automate the specification of a food description using authority terms familiar to a :ref:`depositor <terms-Depositor>`.

An authority can easily verify that :ref:`components <terms-Component>` |_| of a food description accurately represent their data.

Ontomatica has developed :ref:`web services <terms-Web-Service>` that keep integrated data fresh and accurate.
