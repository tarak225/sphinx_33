Ontomatica has developed the most comprehensive database of the Food Stream, using terms and data that conform to U.S. government and international standards.

Database provides ability to analyze and track food from its origins, through growing and processing, to consumption.

Such thorough documentation provides information to improve food safety and determine "cause and effect" of the food we eat.
