FDA Specifications for Food Allergen Labeling
---------------------------------------------

Under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA), food labels are required to state clearly whether the food is or contains any ingredient that is a "major food allergen." The law defines a major food allergen to mean any one of the following eight foods/food groups or an ingredient that contains their proteins:

- milk,

- egg,

- fish (e.g., bass, flounder, or cod),

- Crustacean shellfish (e.g., crab, lobster, or shrimp),

- tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, or pecans),

- peanuts,

- wheat, and

- soybeans.

FALCPA excludes from the definition of a major food allergen:

- raw agricultural commodities (e.g., fresh fruits and vegetables),

- highly refined oils made from one of the eight foods/food groups defined as a major food allergen,

- ingredients made from such oils, and

- any ingredient that is exempt under a petition or notification process specified in FALCPA.

FALCPA requires that food source names of any major food allergen used to make a food be stated either: (1) within the product's ingredient list (e.g. "Ingredients: ...peanut butter...casein (milk)...wheat flour ...") or (2) in a separate "Contains" statement (e.g., "Contains peanuts, milk and wheat") immediately following or adjacent to the ingredient list. When multiple ingredients (e.g., casein and whey) contain protein derived from the same major food allergen (e.g., milk), that allergen's food source name can be declared just once within the ingredient list in accordance with FALCPA labeling requirements. However, when a FALCPA "Contains" statement appears on a food label, it must identify the food source names of all major food allergens contained in the ingredients.

For the purpose of complying with FALCPA labeling requirements, question and answer (Q&A) of FDA's guidance document, which is updated periodically to add new questions, explains that the food source name for a species of fish or Crustacean shellfish is its "market name" provided in the FDA resource The Seafood List. Q&A provides a table of additional examples of types of tree nuts that are frequently used to make foods. The tree nuts' common or usual names are their food source names for FALCPA labeling purposes. Q&A also explain that either the plural or singular terms for peanuts, types of tree nuts, and soybeans and that the synonyms soy and soya for soybeans are acceptable for declaring the food source names of the major food allergens on food labels.

----------------------------------------------
Reviews of Food Ingredients and Finished Foods
----------------------------------------------

This document identifies examples of food ingredients and finished foods that either are or may contain one or more major food allergens. It is not intended to serve as an all-inclusive list. Stated in parentheses after the names of some ingredients/foods are their synonyms and/or a description of what they are or their common uses. Any common synonyms for the terms listed below are also identified using bolded text immediately following those terms in parentheses. Also stated in the parentheses are descriptions of the terms, other related information, and when applicable, reference to the notes section following each allergen subheading.

Some ingredients and finished foods always contain a major food allergen due to their basic nature or when they either have a standard of identity or are otherwise defined or described by Federal law or regulation that confirms the presence of a major food allergen. When ingredients used to make another ingredient or finished food can vary, it may be necessary to review the ingredient specification sheets to determine if the product contains a major food allergen. In other cases, when an ingredient or finished food is derived from the food source of a major food allergen but there is uncertainty about the presence of any protein residue from that allergen, it may be necessary to analyze the food ingredient or the finished food.

Notes:
^^^^^^

- Milk from the domesticated cow is the only type of milk (and its proteins) that is subject to FALCPA labeling requirements. Milk from any other mammal (e.g., goat, sheep, buffalo, etc.) is not, but it must be declared in the ingredient list by its common or usual name (e.g., goat's milk, sheep's milk, water buffalo's milk) when used to make another food. All types of cow's milk (e.g., low-fat, evaporated, sweetened condensed) contain its proteins.

- The following standardized cheeses can be made with cow's milk and/or any combination of milk from cows, sheep or goats:

   - Caciocavallo Siciliano - section 133.111

   - Romano - section 133.183

   - Semisoft - section 133.187

   - Semisoft part skim - section 133.188

   - Soft ripened - section 133.

   - Spiced - section 133.190

   - Spiced, flavored (that conforms to standards for a natural cheese) - section 133.193

   - Part-skim Spiced - section 133.191 

- The following standardized cheeses can be made from either cow's milk or water buffalo milk, but not a combination of the two milks:

   - Mozzarella - section 133.153

   - Low-moisture Mozzarella - section 133.156

   - Part-skim Mozzarella - section 133.157

   - Scamorza - section 133.155

   - Low-moisture Scamorza - section 133.156

   - Part-skim Scamorza - section 133.157

- See regulations at section 130.10 for requirements for foods named by use of a nutrient content claim and a standardized term, e.g. 1% low-fat milk, 2% reduced cheddar cheese.

- When ice cream or frozen custard is made with goat's milk, the product's statement of identity must identify its goat's milk source. See 21 CFR 135.115 for details about these standardized foods.

- The prefix "lact" in the name of a food ingredient commonly indicates a milk derivative.

- "Nondairy" is not equivalent to "milk free." Products that are labeled as "nondairy" (e.g., coffee whiteners, whipped toppings, creamy drinks/drink mixes, and imitation cheese products) may contain casein or caseinates.

- A kosher "D" designation on a label indicates "dairy" or that the product contains "milk-derived ingredients."

- A kosher "DE" designation on a label indicates "dairy equipment" but no actual dairy or milk-derived ingredients were used to make the product.

- The range and composition of sauces is so varied that this group of condiments can potential contain any one of the major food allergens.

- Batters used as coatings for deep-fat-fried foods commonly contain milk.

Notes:
^^^^^^

- The egg of the domesticated chicken is the only type of egg (and its proteins) that is subject to FALCPA labeling requirements. Eggs from other types of fowl (e.g., ducks, turkeys, ostriches, etc.) are not, but must be declared in the ingredient list by their respective common or usual names (e.g., duck egg, turkey egg, ostrich egg) when used to make another food.  Both the yolks and whites of an egg contain its proteins.

- Binders, coagulants, and emulsifiers are three common functions of certain ingredients that could contain egg proteins.

- The prefix "ov" or "ovo" in the name of a food ingredient commonly indicates an egg derivative.

- Breads and other baked foods with a shiny glaze may indicate that egg whites were brushed on the surface before baking.

- Yellow-colored breads, other baked foods, and pasta may indicate that egg yolks were used as an ingredient.

- The range and composition of sauces is so varied that this group of condiments can potentially contain any one of the major food allergens.

- Batters used as coatings for deep-fat-fried foods commonly contain egg.

- Pasta is a common term which refers to the standardized foods macaroni products, where egg ingredients are optional, and noodle products, where egg ingredients are required

   (fish protein product commonly used to make "imitation" crab and lobster)

whole fish protein concentrate
   (defined food additive; also known as fish meal or fish flour)

Worcestershire sauce
   (commonly made with the fish anchovies or sardines)

Notes:
^^^^^^

- The range and composition of sauces is so varied that this group of condiments can potentially contain any one of the major food allergens.

- Because FALCPA exempts highly refined oils from the definition of a major food allergen, any highly refined fish oil (e.g., one that has been refined, bleached and deodorized) is not a major food allergen. Therefore, the particular fish from which a highly refined oil is derived should not be included in any FALCPA "Contains" statement that appears on the food label. Nevertheless, in accordance with 101.4(b)(14), regardless of whether or not it is highly refined, the common or usual name of a fish oil must identify its specific food source (e.g., cod liver oil). Also, when a fish oil is used as an ingredient to make another food, it must be declared by its common or usual name in the ingredient list of that food.

------------------------------------------------
Potential Crustacea Shellfish Protein Indicators

barnacles
   (several types are commonly eaten)

bouillabaisse
   (seafood stew typically made with fish and shellfish)

Notes:
^^^^^^

- Tree nuts are used in a variety of products, e.g., breads, pies/pie crusts, pastries and other baked goods, candy/candy bars, chocolate, energy bars, cereals and ice cream.

- The range and composition of sauces is so varied that this group of condiments can potentially contain any one of the major food allergens.

- Dietary supplements, like Ginkgo biloba L., that are derived from the roots, leaves, stems, bark, or other non-nut parts of the same plants that bear tree nuts are not subject to FALCPA labeling requirements.

- Because FALCPA exempts highly refined oils from the definition of a major food allergen, any highly refined tree nut oil (e.g., one that has been refined, bleached and deodorized) is not a major food allergen. Therefore, the particular tree nut from which a highly refined oil is derived should not be included in any FALCPA "Contains" statement that appears on the food label. Nevertheless, in accordance with 101.4(b)(14), regardless of whether or not it is highly refined, the common or usual name of a tree nut oil must identify its specific food source (e.g., coconut oil). Also, when a tree nut oil is used as an ingredient to make another food, it must be declared by its common or usual name in the ingredient list of that food.

- See regulations at section 101.4(b)(14) for provisions allowing the use of "and/or" labeling for vegetable oils and vegetable oil shortenings, which could be derived from tree nuts (e.g., palm nut and coconut). When such "and/or" labeling is used, the specific common or usual name of each vegetable oil that may be present must be declared within the ingredient list of the food.

Notes:
^^^^^^

- FALCPA labeling requirements apply to all grains that belong to the plant genus called Triticum, the crossbred hybrid of wheat and rye called "triticale," and ingredients that contain proteins of any of these grains.

- The term "flour" alone (unqualified) should only be used as a synonym for "wheat flour." If "flour" is stated in an ingredient list without the parenthetical declaration of wheat afterwards, either the term "wheat" must appear elsewhere within the ingredient list for another allergenic ingredient or in a separate "Contains" statement. 

- The term "starch" alone (unqualified) should only be used as a synonym for "cornstarch." With the exception of "food starch - modified" (or modified food starch), when listed as an ingredient on food labels, all other types of starches must identify their respective sources (e.g., wheat starch, potato starch, and tapioca starch).

- "Glutinous flour" is a term used to refer to a flour made from glutinous rice and not wheat.

- Pasta is a common term which refers to the standardized foods macaroni products and noodle products that must be made with wheat protein-containing ingredients.

- The range and composition of sauces is so varied that this group of condiments can potentially contain any one of the major food allergens. Wheat flour is commonly used as a thickener for many sauces as well as gravies, soups and stews.

- Batters used as coatings for deep-fat-fried foods commonly contain wheat flour or bread crumbs.

Notes:
^^^^^^

- See regulations at section 101.4(b)(14) for provisions allowing the use of "and/or" labeling for vegetable oils and vegetable oil shortenings, which could be derived from soybeans. When such "and/or" labeling is used, the specific common or usual name of each vegetable oil that may be present must be declared within the ingredient list of the food.

- The range and composition of sauces is so varied that this group of condiments can potentially contain any one of the major food allergens. Also, soy sauce and tamari are commonly used as ingredients to make many other sauces.

- Japanese, Chinese and many Southeast Asian cuisines commonly use soy sauce, tofu, and other soy protein-containing ingredients.

- Vegetarian foods are commonly made with soy protein-containing ingredients.
