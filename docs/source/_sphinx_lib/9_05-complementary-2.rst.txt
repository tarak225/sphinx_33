  Each :class:`Genome` contains many :class:`Chromosomes <Chromosome>`
    Each :class:`Chromosome` contains many :class:`Supercontigs <Supercontig>`
      Each :class:`Supercontig` contains one ``continuous`` data set
        Each ``continuous`` data set is a numpy.array of floating
        point numbers with a column for each data track and a row
        for each base in the data set.
