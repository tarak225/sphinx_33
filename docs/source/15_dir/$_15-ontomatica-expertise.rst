Research Data Depository
========================

Ontomatica is building a data depository where results from scientific research about foods, agriculture and related compounds and substances will be stored.

Glucosinolate Content in Brassica is a prototype.

Depository components are summarized in `use case` below.

- Isothiocyanates occur widely in nature and are of interest in food science and medicine. Vegetable foods with characteristic flavors due to isothiocyanates include wasabi, horseradish, mustard, radish, Brussels sprouts, watercress, nasturtiums, and capers. These vegetables generate isothiocyanates in different proportions and have unique flavors.

- Isothiocyanates are produced by enzymatic conversion of metabolites called `glucosinolates <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_ChEFS_/Flamenco?q=facet_ChEBI_R105:163190>`_. `Sulforaphane <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_ChEFS_/Flamenco?q=facet_ChEBI_R105:311396&group=facet_ChEBI_R105>`_ is a type of isothiocyanate. It is produced when enzyme `thioglucosidase <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_ChEMATIC_v02_-_14-08-21_/Flamenco?q=facet_AG_03:37004573/facet_MD_08:68264665&group=facet_MD_08&index=2>`_ transforms `glucoraphanin <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_ChEFS_/Flamenco?q=facet_ChEBI_R105:179426>`_, a glucosinolate, into sulforaphane upon damage to the plant (such as from chewing), which allows two compounds to mix and react.

- Sulforaphane is a potent inducer of `metabolic detoxication, phase 2 <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_ChEMATIC_v02_-_14-08-21_/Flamenco?q=facet_MG_01:48012197>`_. Detoxication 2 induction is associated with reduced susceptibility of animals and their cells to toxic and neoplastic effects of carcinogens. Data from several research projects demonstrate that Sulforaphane blocks chemical carcinogenesis.

- Research data about sulforaphane, specific vegetables, detoxication 2 and chemical carcinogenesis will be managed by Ontomatica Depository and accessible to other Researchers.

Food specifications designed for a Food SPL
===========================================

`Structured Product Labeling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_Product_Labeling>`_ (SPL) is a document markup standard approved by Health Level Seven (HL7) and adopted by US FDA as a mechanism for exchanging drug product information.

Ontomatica modified US FDA SPL structure as a mechanism for exchanging food product information

- As a baseline, here are `lasagna nutrient properties <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_SR23-NDB_-_14-01-25_/Flamenco?q=Lasagna&index=3>`_ from USDA Standard Reference.

- Here are `lasagna nutrient properties <http://www.ontomatica.com/public/docs/html/resources/lasagna_meat_-_ingredients_and_SR_values_-_14-04-08_.htm>`_ in a form consistent with US FDA SPL structure.

Comprehensive Ontologies
========================

Ontomatica work is represented as an ontology and documented in `Web Ontology Language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language>`_ (OWL) format. Three examples - Pizza, Wheat and Microbiome - are presented.

Pizza Ontology
``````````````

An example of a food ontology is Pizza Ontology. As a baseline, here is pizza as implemented in `USDA FNDDS <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_USDA_FNDDS_-_EPA_FCID_-_14-01-16_/Flamenco?q=facet_A_FNDDS3_Food:9960&group=facet_A_FNDDS3_View>`_.

- `Pizza Ontology <http://www.ontomatica.com/public/ontologies/pizza.owl>`_ as implemented in OWL.

- `Pizza Ontology <http://www.ontomatica.com/public/docs/html/resources/pizza_Manchester_example_v1-4_DAG_-_14-06-02_.html>`_ as a Graph.

- `Pizza Ontology <http://www.ontomatica.com/public/docs/html/resources/pizza_Manchester_simplified_OWL_individual_products_-_14-06-02_.html>`_ as multiple Graphs for easier reading.

Wheat Ontology
``````````````

Ontomatica Wheat Ontology has two dimensions: (1) Facets associated with process of growing wheat; (2) Predicates expressing relationships between wheat and Facet Terms.

Figure below summarizes 13 Facet Classes and 13 Predicate Classes that define wheat.

Specific type of wheat (i.e., cultivar) is the Item.

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Facets", "Predicates relating Facets to Item (wheat)"
   :widths: 15, 20

   "Plant (weed)", "Anatomy and Morphology"
   "Insect", "Development"
   "Fungus", "Pathology"
   "Bacteria", "Action and Usage"
   "Virus", "Administration"
   "Animal", "Trait"
   "Chemical", "Bioactive Property"
   "Soil", "Biochemical Pathway"
   "Atmosphere", "Breeding and Genetic Improvement"
   "Water", "Farming System"
   "Time", "Metrology"
   "Geographical Location", "Agricultural Economics"
   "Agricultural Machinery", "Authority, Law and Regulation"
   
Wheat Ontology is used to represent `USDA Objective Description of Wheat <http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3003730>`_ as an electronic message.

Microbiome Ontology
```````````````````

Human microbiome is Classes of microbes that participate in process of unlocking dietary plant and animal nutrients.

Microbes include `bacteria <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_ChEMATIC_v02_-_14-08-21_/Flamenco?q=facet_MB_01:99002577>`_, `archaea <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_ChEMATIC_v02_-_14-08-21_/Flamenco?q=facet_MB_01:99002515>`_ and `viruses <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_ChEMATIC_v02_-_14-08-21_/Flamenco?q=facet_MB_01:99004246>`_, such as `bacteriophages <http://72.167.253.87/cgi-bin/flamenco.cgi/_ChEMATIC_v02_-_14-08-21_/Flamenco?q=facet_MB_01:99004256&group=facet_MB_01>`_.

Ontomatica Microbiome Ontology implements relationships between food intake; bacteria, archaea and viruses; human anatomy (location of microbe Classes e.g., human gut); and, health outcomes.
